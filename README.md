# Sudoku-Solver

Takes a sudoku visualizer from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/building-and-visualizing-sudoku-game-using-pygame/ and adds to it advanced
sudoku techniques in order to speed up solve times. Even after these advancements the build still ultimately relies on backtracking in the worst case.

This project was created as an exploration of the P vs NP problem and was an attempt to better understand why large sudoku boards are probably impossible to solve
without backtracking.
